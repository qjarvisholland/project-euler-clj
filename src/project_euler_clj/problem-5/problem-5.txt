;; Problem 5
;; 2520 is the smallest number that can be 
;; divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
;; What is the smallest positive number that is 
;; evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

(can-be-divided-by (range 1 10) (smallest-number-that))
= 2520

(can-be-divided-by (range 1 20) (smallest (n)))

(defn can-be-divided-by
"literate way of saying rem 0"
[n x]
(if (% n x) nil n))

(defn can-be-divided-by
"literate way of saying rem 0"
[n x]
(if (zero? (mod n x)) n nil))
